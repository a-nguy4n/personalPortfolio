          My design journal is about exploring key design principles seen in the usability of everyday objects and digital interfaces. <br>
          I analyze how well designs guide users through actions, provide clear feedback, and match their mental models, ensuring <br>
          smooth and intuitive interactions. Through reflections on good and bad design, I learn what makes a product <br>
          efficient and user-friendly, and how poor design choices can lead to frustration and confusion.
